Hi guys, welcome to our project! There are few things you need to know before you start your work and make the world a
better place by this spam project ðŸ˜Š.

# Important things that you need to know
- Feel free to commit files **[under your folder](https://github.com/chengkaiyang2025/Summer-2025-ECE-597-Group11/tree/dev/code/draft)**. 
- Make sure you submit on **dev** branch. I highly recommend don't modify others' files in case there is a git conflict.
- Please do not submit or upload or push big file (for example, larger than 10MB size), or too many files(1k+) on GitHub. Please don't upload the giving spam dataset. 
- Please don't use git force push command, it could overwrite others work.
- Again, **please DO NOT submit on main branch**. 

# Not so important things but still matter

- If you feel like you can't finish your part of work on time, it's totally okay, just seek for help before the deadline, 
we will help you.
- If possible, please join the group discussion every 2 week in-person, if there is one.
- You can use colab to write your code, and use web browser to upload/commit your code or files. You don't have to set up local python environment,
or IDE(vscode,pycharm,miniconda,pyenv, etc.) before you start your work.
- **Please be a team player**, and make sure draw plots or having plots, tables etc. during your solo work, because **others will need them in the final report and presentation**.
